#1 receive a number n that must be larger than zero 
#2 write down 1,2,3 as the first three numbers of the sequence 
#3 if n is 1, 2 or 3 then output 1; 1,2; and 1,2,3; respectfully and end. 
#4 if n is larger than 3 then i start counting from 3 
#5 add the sum of the first three numbers as the next number in the sequence 
#6 add the sum of the last three numbers in the sequence and add the sum to
#  the sequence
#7 add one to the count for every sum you add to the sequence
#8 when the count is equal to n then output the whole sequence and end
#9 repeat steps 6,7,8
